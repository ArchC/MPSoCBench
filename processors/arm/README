This is the ARMv5e ArchC 2.2 functional model.

This model has the system call emulation functions implemented,
so it is a good idea to turn on the ABI option.

To use acsim, the interpreted simulator:

    acsim armv5e.ac -abi                (create the simulator)
    make -f Makefile.archc              (compile)
    armv5e.x --load=<file-path> [args]  (run an application)

The [args] are optional arguments for the application.

There are two formats recognized for application <file-path>:
- ELF binary matching ArchC specifications
- hexadecimal text file for ArchC


To generate binary utilities use:

    acbingen.sh -i<abs-install-path> -a<arch-name> armv5e.ac

This will generate the tools source files using the architecture
name <arch-name> (if omitted, armv5e is used), copy them to the
binutils source tree, build and install them into the directory
<abs-install-path> (which -must- be an absolute path).
Use "acbingen.sh -h" to get information about the command-line
options available.
